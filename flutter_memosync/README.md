# MemoSync
## WIP: This project is still very much a work in progress

TLDR: If you need memos to remind you of things but you forget to check your memos, this app is for you.

Memosync is a cross-platform application synchronizing your memos, with a focus on intrusion (alerts, backgrounds, permanent notifications,...) and it's obviously open-source.

## Rough roadmap
    - Release on android
    - Rework of backend for full user privacy
    - Release to other platforms (linux, windows, mac, web, embedded devices,...)
